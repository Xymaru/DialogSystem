# 1. What is a Dialog System?
A dialog system is a gameplay mechanic that is used in many role-playing games (RPG). When the player interacts with a non-player character (NPC), it will start a conversation which may or may not give the player choices of what to say.

# 2. Types of dialogs
## 2.1. Simple dialogs
A simple dialog is a dialog that doesn't have any choices for the player, that means, it's a linear conversation that will not have any changes.
One common technique is to make linear conversations with choices, giving the players the feeling that they are affecting the conversation.

## 2.2. Branching dialog
Branching dialogs are dialogs that are not linear, the NPC will have a dialog tree with all the possible paths the conversation can go through, depending on the choices of the player. Branching dialogs usually curve back on themselves, so that player choices will give a different response but it will stick back to the same branch.
