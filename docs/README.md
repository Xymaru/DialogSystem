# 1. What is a Dialogue System?
A dialogue system is a gameplay mechanic that is used in many role-playing games (RPG). When the player interacts with a non-player character (NPC), it will start a conversation which may or may not give the player choices of what to say.
# 2. Types of dialogues
## 2.1. Simple dialogue
A simple dialogue is a dialogue that doesn't have any choices for the player, that means, it's a linear conversation that will not have any changes.
Some games also make linear conversations with choices, giving the players the feeling that they are affecting the conversation.
